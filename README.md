# hapi-app
The sample of simple Hapi app

## Prerequisites
You need Node.js and MongoDB installed on your client machine. You also need to install dependencies globally.

## Note
If you want to implement this into your code or use this as a boilerplate make sure that you are using the correct versions of these dependencies:
- Hapi - v16.4.3 (the latest version of Hapi does not support this boilerplate/code)
- Inert - v4.2.0
- Vision - v4.1.1

Current [documentation](https://hapijs.com) for Hapijs is updated for the latest version - 17.2.0.

# Install

```bash
$ npm install 
```
